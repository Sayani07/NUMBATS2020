# Formulating ideas <br> Median Maximum Pairwise Distance (MMPD)

## What did you look at?

 * Gestalt theory
 * within group variation?  (**maximum pairwise dissimilarity ordered/unordered** across x-axis labels)
 * between group variation? (highest **average** within group variation over facets)
 * higher number of levels? (choosing **normalization**)
 * Are the variations "significant" enough to be interesting? (choosing **threshold**)

--

 <!--  between distributions of x-axis labels -->
 <!--  **Ordered** or **unordered** -->
 <!--  higher **average** maximum ordered pairwise dissimilarity across facets -->
 <!-- * Choosing **normalization** to account for different levels -->
 <!-- * Choosing **threshold** to screen those harmonies for which MMPD significantly different from zero -->


<!-- # Features of MMoPD  -->

<!-- - Choosing threshold to further screen the best pairs for visualization -->
<!-- - normalization -->
<!-- - Conduct permutation tests -->
<!-- <!-- - Designed to select the median --> -->
<!-- <!-- - Within group variation --> -->
<!-- <!-- - Between group variation --> -->
<!-- - Distance between probability distribution measured through JSD only at desired quantiles -->
<!-- - Assumption that this distance follows Normal distribution assymptotically -->

<!-- give the uniform best harmory in all situations? When will fail/succeed? -->



<!-- ## Normalization -->

<!--  * Maximum is more if number of levels is more -->
<!--  * Distribution of maximum -->
<!--  * norming constant depend on underlying distribution of distances -->
<!--  * Median goes at the rate of log(n) as n goes to infinity -->

# Formulating ideas (MMoPD)

 * Gestalt theory
 * more x-axis levels? (Normalization)
 * if **maximum pairwise dissimilarity** between distributions of x-axis labels is higher, graph is more interesting
 * if **ordered** pairwise dissimilarity is more, graph is even more interesting
 * for higher **average** ordered pairwise dissimilarity across facets, harmonies are more interesting

---

# Choosing threshold to further screen the best pairs for visualization

- Conduct permutation tests



---

# Features of MMoPD 

- Designed to select the median
- Within group variation
- Between group variation
- Distance between probability distribution measured through JSD only at desired quantiles
- Assumption that this distance follows Normal distribution assymptotically

<!-- give the uniform best harmory in all situations? When will fail/succeed? -->



<!-- ## Normalization -->

<!--  * Maximum is more if number of levels is more -->
<!--  * Distribution of maximum -->
<!--  * norming constant depend on underlying distribution of distances -->
<!--  * Median goes at the rate of log(n) as n goes to infinity -->
